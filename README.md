# LEARNING SPECIES COUNTERPOINT
The idea for this project stems from the musical studies of one of the authors, who was enrolled in a Harmony class at the time of this projectâ€™s conception. In the first half of said Harmony class, students are asked to analyze Bach chorales and then attempt to replicate the found patterns and techniques to compose their own melodies, all while conforming to the rules of species counterpoint. As this author also happened to be a computer science student, he immediately recognized that his repetitious homework assignments, that consisted of following a set of strict rules, could be easily and elegantly formulated as a problem in AI.
